In short, after I got salaries from descriptions using regular expressions, I divided data into USD and pound lists, then divied even further to year, day hour etc. .  and then took average and how many times specific range appeared. As u see there were a lot of diffrent formats so I took this approach: If there was range , I took sum of first and second element and dividied it byt 2. If not, i jsut used single value as average.
