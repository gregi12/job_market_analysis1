In short, after I got salaries from offers using regular expressions, I divided data into USD and pound lists, then divided even further to year, day hour etc. . In next step, I took average and how many times specific range occurred. As u see, there were a lot of diffrent formats so I took this approach: If there was range , I took sum of first and second element and dividied it by 2. If not, I just used single value as average. If salary was per hour, I  multiplied it by 2080 (8 hours per day, 260 workdays in year as google says) </p>"
